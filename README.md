WekaKrislet
===========

This projects aims to modify the default behaviour of the Krislet soccer playing agent by taking advantage of existing machine learning tools (i.e. Weka). By capturing the server interaction logs from a pre-existing agent, the intent is to feed that set of 'training' data into a Weka J48 learning classifier to drive the logic behind a modified Krislet agent taking into account current perceived environment states.
